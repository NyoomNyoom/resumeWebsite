# Resume Website
## About this project
This is the repository to host my resume and portfolio. The site is going to be built in react and JS so that I can gain experience in the react framework and JS language. 

### Hosting
I will end up hosting the website on my laptop and eventually a home server.
I will be following this [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/deploy-react-application-with-nginx-on-ubuntu) on how to host my react app on a ubuntu server. I will be using apache instead of Nginx as this is what I know.
