            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This project is a clone of the command prompt. I developed the first few modules using guidance from a free course on Code Crafters. How ever, it was up to me to chose
                the language that I coded in and if I wanted to continue this further. I chose C++ to code this in as it was a langauge I knew little about and wanted to learn more about.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/NyoomNyoom/NyoomNyoom-CC-shell-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">github</a>. Please feel free to view this and follow the steps in the README file on how to
                clone and run this project your self!
